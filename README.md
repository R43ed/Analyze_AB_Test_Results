## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Each **ToDo** task below has an associated quiz present in the classroom.  Though the classroom quizzes are **not necessary** to complete the project, they help ensure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1214/view) specification. 

>**Tip**: Though it's not a mandate, students can attempt the classroom quizzes to ensure statistical numeric values are calculated correctly in many cases.
